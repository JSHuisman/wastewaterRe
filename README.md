# Wastewater-based estimation of the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 

This repository contains the code for the manuscript "Wastewater-based estimation of the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2" by Jana S. Huisman, Jeremie Scire, Lea Caduff, Xavier Fernandez-Cassi, Pravin Ganesanandamoorthy, Anina Kull, Andreas Scheidegger, Elyse Stachler, Alexandria B. Boehm, Aaron Topol, Krista R. Wigginton, Marlene K. Wolfe, Tamar Kohn, Christoph Ort, Tanja Stadler, and Timothy R. Julian.

The scripts in this repository assume that the code of the Re estimation pipeline of Huisman et al. is available in a folder "covid-19-re-shiny-app" at the same level as this repository. The git-repo for the pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/covid-19-Re/shiny-dailyRe).

## Code
The code is split into 3 parts: general functions, the analysis of the Zurich data, and the analysis of the San Jose data.
